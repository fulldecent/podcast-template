* Utility: you can vote on upcoming initiatives/work, general prestige
* 100 karma for staying to the end of a call each week (top 20 people if there are many?)
* XXX karma for an accepted pull request on our PROJECT BOARD (see above)
* Consider soulbound fungible tokens ("karma"/"community"/"thank you" points), should points systems only allow increasing?, should lifetime points and "power" (decaying amount) be separate?


# NFT 2023 bingo

Things we might see in 2023 actually happen



* A music release mentioned in Rolling Stone magazine or Billboard is somehow released with/using/twinning NFTs

* A US senator, representative, or executive department official that has a notable-verified checkmark on Twitter releases an NFT series capitalizing on their reputation
* A person using Instagram will sell NFTs from the platform achieving market value over USD 10m
* You buy a product in Walmart with a QR code on the retail box exterior that links to that specific product (serial number) that is somehow recorded on an immutable ledger
* A game with more MAU than Horizon Games adopts a usable asset in the game which is somehow recorded on an immutable ledger
* Reddit Avatar NFTs are useable somewhere other than on Reddit
* More than USD 10B of asset holder funds are lost/locked/inaccessible due to some market exchange company/smart contract failure
* New regulation makes Binance/TRON/or similar sized exchange impermissible in the US like Tornado Cash
* A "Crypto Kitties" moment in a A/AA/AAA game with a collectable/monetization/verified thing that somehow relates to blockchain (which everyone will copy)
* Twitter Spaces doubles MAU
* An indie label gives out "gift cards" that fans can redeem and which pay[https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1526378796173012992](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1526378796173012992) the artist

Reviewed homework from @exstalis checking out a 2-dimensional (or 3-dimensional) metaverse construct. What is the metadata we would need for tokenizing this?
* Some solutions are: first-dibs/gold-rush for spaces (like DNS/Minecraft) or another way is allowing anybody to use points (like Foursquare/Instagram)
* How do you zoom in when there are too many people in one place? Maybe like Craigslist…

* Questions from @037 (misc):
    * When deploying smart contracts with no hard controls to freeze assets, etc. how can we stay compliant to AML and not face jail like Tornado cash dev Alexsey Pertsev while also ensuring users trust us with no "owner" role?
        * See episode about nothing is decentralized: episode 26
        * Don’t see regulators going after technology, but rather how it’s marketed (so far)
    * What are some modern ways to fuzz your custom smart contract code? Are there any good frameworks for security scanning contract code during runtime?
        * Smart contracts best practice is not to use fuzzing, but rather 100% test coverage
    * Are there any ex post factos to pending/future SEC regulations surrounding smart contract development? Could I get in trouble if I deploy something now and then SEC requires a control mechanism that doesn't exist and cannot be added (since smart contracts are set in stone after deploy)
        * SEC has rules but also //ask// CFTC

* ChatGPT’s **holiday dialogue**:  Imagine a family holiday discussion about NFTs during Christmas dinner in 2022. Can you write a short and funny dialogue about this?
    * Sure! Here is a short and funny dialogue about NFTs during a family holiday dinner:
    * Dad: "So, I read this article about NFTs the other day. Apparently, people are paying millions of dollars for virtual art!"
    * Mom: "Oh, come on. That's just a fad. No one is going to pay that much money for something that doesn't even exist in the physical world."
    * Sister: "But they do exist! They're stored on the blockchain, so they're completely unique and can't be replicated."
    * Brother: "I could have told you that. I've been buying NFTs for years. I even have one of a pixelated cat that's worth over a hundred thousand dollars!"
    * Dad: "Well, I'll stick to my old paintings. At least I can touch them and hang them on the wall."
    * Sister: "Suit yourself, Dad. But when my NFT collection is worth a fortune, don't say I didn't try to tell you about it."
    * Mom: "Can we please talk about something else now? I'd rather not spend the whole dinner talking about virtual art."
    * I hope you found this dialogue amusing!
* ChatGPT’s advice on how to fail the Howie Test with your NFT project:  **How can one develop an NFT project that does not pass the Howie Test?**
    * The Howey Test is a legal test that is used to determine whether a particular transaction is an investment contract, and therefore subject to securities laws. The test is named after the Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., which established the criteria for determining whether a transaction is an investment contract.
    * If you want to develop an NFT project that does not pass the Howie Test, there are a few steps you can take:
    * **Avoid promising returns or profits: **One of the key criteria of the Howie Test is whether the purchaser is expecting to receive profits from the investment. To avoid being classified as an investment contract, you should avoid promising returns or profits to the purchaser.
    * **Make the NFTs available for immediate use: **Another criterion of the Howie Test is whether the purchaser is expecting to use the investment for personal or business purposes. If the NFTs are available for immediate use, rather than being held for speculation or resale, it is less likely that the transaction will be considered an investment contract.
    * **Don't market the NFTs as an investment: **Finally, you should be careful not to market the NFTs as an investment opportunity. Instead, focus on the artistic or functional value of the NFTs.
    * It's worth noting that even if an NFT project does not pass the Howie Test, it may still be subject to other laws and regulations, such as consumer protection laws or anti-money laundering regulations. It's always a good idea to consult with a lawyer or other legal advisor before launching an NFT project.

* Sander @ [WOF Labs](https://worldoffreight.xyz)
    * Started in 2021, with the mission to create a blockchain for supply chains
    * World of Freight NFTs
        * Built a mini-game
        * Aiming to make it a supply chain simulator – racing game
        * First infrastructure for other games – NFT renting
            * Let ppl put up for rent for # of games or certain time
            * Renter puts up payment or share a % of winnings
            * Using Chainlink’s keepers
            * Font-end – original owners see their ‘Fleets’ and choose which to rent
                * Internal marketplace
            * Not moving assets
            * Previously:  Either direct p2p renting or a 3rd party guarantees giving back (but this only makes sense for high value assets with enough collateral)
            * Newer:  Proxy wallets, allowing just view permissions to share but not write permissions
            * Can put the assets in escrow, but this wastes gas
            * Game runs on polygon, but assets are on Ethereum
            * You can even sell during the rental and rental contracts just get voided and pre-payment returned
            * All transaction info is on-chain
            * Considering using Unlock protocol
        * Currently in documentation and testing phase

    * Entrepreneur for many years
* [NFT Tallinn](https://nfttallinn.com), Estonia May 9, 2023
    * Why go?
        * Estonia gov’t have been using blockchain for years
        * Gov’t using KSI (sp?) blockchain since 2008
        * All health records are timestamped
        * CTO and CIO of Estonian gov’t will be there
        * Bored Apes and bananas
        * 2023
            * Events for fintech, sustainability, and others
            * VIP Poker event
    * See past episode Episode 19—Reentrancy
* Estonian gov’t
    * Want to have all relevant gov’t data on blockchain and let users build apis and dapps on it
    * Near Sweden fintech, Finland gaming, Estonia – many web3 companies are coming to the region
* Where do you see the WOF labs going long-term?
    * All info gets stored on blockchain
    * Games are lightyears ahead of supply chain use case, so start there
    * Originally thought the tech was ready – tried to make a layer directly connecting suppliers and retailers
    * As we went deeper, realized finance is a language that everyone speaks – standards, but not connectivity – some using APIs, some just sending Excel spreadsheets
    * Wanted to build translators from the old ways to blockchain without impacting old workflows too much
    * Spent first year getting feedback and went to the market
    * Over the past six months, talked to about 500 stakeholders in the space. Many are already familiar with blockchain. Many tried using Hyperledger in 2017/18 and hated the experience. In the process, they learned their infrastructure needed rebuilding. COVID forced this to accelerate. Will start happening in 2-4 years on supply chain infrastructure side
    * Min 100k transactions per second at 1 cent per transaction
    * Company behind KSI blockchain
        * Works w/ US military and EU central bank
        * Building a layer-1 called AlphaBill
        * Biggest question is not the tech, but the taxonomy
        * Everyone will be “made” to collaborate in order for it to work
* Game is the place to start

* OpenSea requires all new NFT projects to enforce on-chain creator fees, or get demonetized
    * Is this anticompetitive in an illegal or disallowed way?
    * Why didn’t OpenSea just let people opt-out of royalties?
    * Feels like the artist is being held for ransom rather than actually being helped

        * onlyAllowedOperatorApproval modifier
    * Is this still better for artists than what was before OpenSea/NFT marketplaces?
    * Spent all this time writing documentation and tweeting about it, but didn’t even implement it in their own store yet
* An extension for token contracts: make setApprovalForAll cheaper
    * Use messages, Gas-free setApprovalForAll
    * Extension of 20/721/1155
    * Doesn’t change how royalties work, if users want to apply royalties
    * Breakdown explanation
        * Have to Approve when listing on OpenSea
        * Signed message doesn’t need to settle on-chain until you actually transfer the token
    * Anyone who works at Blur, X2/Y2, Rarible, Looksrare to try this out?
    * See EIP-1153 royalty router

            * burn() (which seems to be ignored)

            * Bondexpiry called underlying(), asked robot
            * Robot lies about underlying
            * Bond contract then performs transfer for the balance amount
        * Should not have trusted bond contract
        * Should not let underlying() be updated–it should be set at the beginning
    * = "function is broken bad, anything can happen"
    * Options: don't hack, hack and get ALL the money; non-option: hack and get some of the money
        * If you don’t, someone else will finish the job right away (everything you do on-chain is public)
        * White hat – take the money and then you have the option to give it all back
            * What difference does intentionality make? How do governments address it when someone claims they are white hats?
            * It might not be obvious where to return the money

![alt_text](images/image15.jpg "image_tooltip")

* IDEAS:
    * ThankYou.wtf manifesto
        * What is a thank you?
            * It's public, from somebody, to somebody, and it includes a message, and some points. The points don't matter.
            * Maybe if you send ZERO points it is a message (avoid libel) it's a warning to your friends that you endorsed somebody and you don't like them any more?
            * Is this "gossip"?
            * "Soulbound FUNGIBLE tokens"
        * Why do I want a thank you?
            * Receiving a thank you can make you feel good. Good feelings increase health, longevity and quality of life.
            * Seeing thank yous from people you care about to new people can inform you if you want to be around those new people.
        * How do you send it?
            * You publish to ThankYou.wtf and blockchain using a signed message.
            * Or if you don't publish it then it sits on the ThankYou.wtf for 2 weeks. Maybe the recipient or somebody else will publish it. If nobody publishes it, the TYwtf website deletes it. If you somehow publish it directly onto a blockchain, the TYwtf website will pick it up.
        * How do you receive it? ???? DO WE WANT THIS PART? JUST HAVE THEM SEND A THANK YOU BACK?
            * You don't have to receive it.
        * Who are you sending it to?
            * Can send to a website (see Chrome list of common website domains), a specific page (twitter profile?), or a blockchain address.
        * How does the message work?
            * You type whatever you want. Up to 280 characters.
        * How do the points work?
            * You can send as many points as you want. You can make your points be any color or design. (ERC-1155.) Anybody can send themself points, they don't matter.
            * All the points (and messages) you send out to each person will show up on your page. If people care about your points the ThankYou.wtf website will also show them on the recipient's page.
            * You can send at most X points to a person at a time.
        * How is this built
            * Thank yous are signed messages like \
THANKYOU/RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_OR_HASH/POINTS/MESSAGE
            * how to do timestamps? how to revoke yourself?
            * Which blockchain do they settle on? can people repost them on other chains?
        * How can I connect my product to ThankYou.wtf?
            * You can send thank yous on chain or send to us. (Spam prevention?)
            * You can read the points, these are SBTs. And you can use them to authenticate into a website.
            * Points only go up as time goes on. But you can also calculate POWER which is some function of points and recency. You can use this power to control access to your community or help you make decisions (do we want to say voting?
        * Is there censorship / distributed?
            * You are free to use ThankYou.wtf however you like. We can censor the Thank Yous that you send to us if necessary or if it makes our product better. But we cannot censor anything you send directly to the blockchain or which you distribute in other ways.
        * What does it cost?
            * This product is free to use on ThankYou.wtf and on blockchains near you.
            * Our operating expenses are X and we received X donations. You can send thank yous to this project at Y.
            * If you would like to host your own copy of this project or maybe don't like our branding, call us. We work as consultants, call us, prices start at USD 10,000.
        * Other features
            * Email login to get notified of thank yous.
            * Browser extension to thank you any website (see Brave extension and how it find the author of any page)
        * More notes
            * Is this more like LinkedIn where have a million connections and don't even know these people, like Twitter where I might know them or just want to read them, or like my phone contacts list where these are really people I know?
            * Snap chat has streaks each day
            * Tying accounts to 
* Community Service Hour Army

* Moonstream.to
* Want to build games that people _want_ to spend their lives playing, without any dark design patterns but rather because they love it

* HOw to decentralize?
    * Moonstream will probably never do a token
    * Things to avoid in decentralization
        * Transactional, financially-oriented relationships
        * Don’t want to build things that will break at scale	
    * Will wrote a paper about the game theory of this
        * Can’t avoid transactional nature of decentralized systems
        * Instead, designers have parameters to tune

    * Neeraj says no
    * Big tech company example
    * When community becomes too large 
    * Federation seems to work
    * Book: Driving Honda: Inside the World's Most Innovative Car Company
* Is Neeraj a game designer?
    * Maybe old school game designers are not the best for designing blockchain games
    * Want all types of game designers in teh community though
    * Cryptounicorns Minigame – designed as not fun, but players found fun and meaning in many aspects of it
* Moonstream has it’s own nodes, crawlers rather than 3rd parties
    * Could use some help on 
* I can give out Remixer NFT badges for people that completed classes before! See [https://rewards.remix.ethereum.eth.limo/](https://rewards.remix.ethereum.eth.limo/) how to organize this?

* How do NFTs that redeem for physical things work?
    * Rawling is a new model [https://nft.rawlings.com](https://nft.rawlings.com) // drops Sep 14
        * Custodial token – NFT can be redeemed for physical glove
        * Different series and price tiers
        * Redemption requires sending the NFT to a burn address
        * Background from David
            * New project for Rawlings
            * Partly for Rawlings to see how much their audience is interested in NFT
            * Already lots of folks who are physical collectors
            * There will be future projects
        * Rawlings knew nothing about NFTs initially, except one person
        * Went through many rounds of talks with them
        * One VP has been on Discord chats and became interested. Got other folks on board.
        * People know them for gloves. Wanted to do an NFT drop that didn’t feel like a cash grab.
        * Wanted to know what would be the more popular model
        * Launch tomorrow
        * Good mix of people with different interests
    * Comparable model to 
        * Wooshie (sp?) – Plushie with a QR code on it
        * Crypto stamps – From Austrian Post. A flag on the NFT, user keeps both at the same time.
        * .arianee – Certificate of Authenticity model. Watches with paired NFTs
* What is the benefit to people that redeem versus hold the tokens?
* Can they both be rare/collectable?
    * Tokens get rarer as they burn
* Should we give perks to both categories of people?
* Be careful sweepstakes / giveaways / state laws on gambling, skill
* What to do with products that aren't redeemed?
* Bonus Rap performance / vinyl drop @rito_rhymes // directory

NOTES



* What if miners continue to mine!!!??? Let's call it POWNet! Difficulty goes down
* Who benefits from POWNet? Who is likely to be the loudest advocate
    * the biggest miners // because they have a sunk cost in mining equipment which becomes useless in POS
    * NVIDIA EthHash
* What is the economic incentive to validate on a non-mainstream POS network?
    * incentive = stake/{total stake} * value
* USD 1M of marketing sells USD 100M of pictures of animals // so USD 10B of marketing can make POWNet valuable enough that miners use it and NVIDIA's stock goes up 40%
* POWNet will be broken for most bridges
* On POWNet what about the difficulty bomb!?

# Episode 38—OpenZeppelin Contracts ECDSA bug

EPISODE 38 ORIGINALLY AIRED 2022-08-23 / [wrap-up Tweet](https://twitter.com/fulldecent/status/1562217336127602688)



*  / 

NOTES



1. What is ECDSA?
    1. A public key and a private key
        1. Can be Eth address
    2. Sign a message with a private key, and anybody can verify against public key
        2. Sign a Eth TX or message
            1. The messages are used on smart contracts to denote authorization
    3. Encrypt message with a public key, and decrypt with a private key
    4. Two types of encoding, 64-byte and 65-byte
        3. Either is accepted for verification in a smart contract
2. ECDSA signature malleability · Advisory · OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/secur lity/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h)
    5. OZ mentioned `ecrecover` opcode malleability
    6. OZ failed to mention the 64/65-bit malleability
    7. Reported other contracts affected ERC1271WalletMock and EIP712External
3. Should make signature acceptance injective rather than surjective
4. Need better code search for live contracts!
    8. At least github search accepts “-” operators
    9. Potential issues with Github search operators for Stars & Forks
5. Found a vulnerability in Zibert bridge ([created Github issue](https://github.com/zibert/bridge/issues/1)) and Hive [https://github.com/cent-inc/hive/issues/1](https://github.com/cent-inc/hive/issues/1)

        * @ZachSpaded
* Can NFT royalty payments be ENFORCED on-chain?
    * Yes, ERC-721 can require payment (of Ether) to transfer (the buyer or seller!) an NFT. But ERC-1155 cannot require this in the safe(Batch)?TransferFrom function.
    * **Question:** how many OpenSea transactions are already using side channel buyer-seller collusion to avoid fees?
        * Key point: the smart contract does NOT know the full sale price (just like government does not know full sale price of your car @snapboogie)
        * Enforce:
            * Seller consigns the asset to auctioneer with no minimum bid
            * If the bid increment is larger than the collusion saving (i.e. royalty/tax/marketplace cost)
        * Enforce on-chain:
            * Only reliable if the fee is a fixed-price fee
            * Using pricing set by some kind of bonding curve or more generic function
                * Time-based (velocity)
                * Total amt of ETH
        * Enforce off-chain:
            * Use an appraiser (oracle, tax investigator)
    * Other encumberances in assets sales (transcations with other silent parties involved)
        * Land grant → sales restrictions to certain parties ("no blacks") or use restrcitons ("no houses" -> local watershed)
        * Each new party agrees to the full terms of sale
    * Should NFT be "sales" or should should be "licenses", licenses have different kinds of terms and there is a different expectation of agreement/law/redistribution/terms from recipients/licensees/"buyers?"
        * ERC-721 uses the word "owner" all over it / ergo there is a reasonoblae expectation that this is "sale" and a license
        * Is there scope to create ERC-721 speciificatnio clone for licenses (that are transferrible?) or an extension that is specifically for licensicng (soulbound?)
* Ways around just about anything
    * Wrapper contracts
* Moral stance

* The Solidity bug
* Minified the bug case significantly from the [Ethereum Foundation’s announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/08/08/calldata-tuple-reencoding-head-overflow-bug/)
* Searched for functions in [OpenSea’s Seaport repo](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) that are subject to the bug
    * ABI code
        * Find all abi.encode…
        * Find all external calls
    * Dynamic
        * Find strings
        * Find bytes
        * Find []
    * Static
        * \[d+\]
* Also search contracts for Zora, Binance NFT Marketplace, Foundation
* Got very close, but didn’t find any!

    * Transaction malleability (replayable)
        * Malleability (maybe TX is signed but then can be changed BUT the original or changed version can only be used once so there is one "nullifier")
            * Read the GM17 paper to see more on this

    * Almost impossible to find the smart contracts on etherscan
    * Why doesn’t the Nomad website:
        * Mention that the contracts are upgradeable
        * Share the actual addresses of their live contracts
    * It does (quietly in the docs):  https://docs.nomad.xyz/operational-security/contracts

NOTES



* @SizzleJia experience // how do scams work // who is legally responsible? // what to do?
    * @OnChain Monkey new collection called Karma
    * Minted the new collection, but NFT requires 12 hours to reveal which one it is
    * Got as invitation in official Discord to "mint a special drop", appeared to be a founder
        * Linked to minting webpage
            * MetaMask had a warning "this is a dangerous action", she rejected it
    * Disconnected setApprovalForAll
    * Reported to OpenSea and flagged, cannot be listed for sale
    * Compare to other sales platforms // buying stocks in a regulated marketplace // buying stolen merchandise
        * Is OpenSea like a broker/dealer? Custody is different. Known counterparty is different.
        * **Did OpenSea flag other assets that the thief from SizzleJia's OnChain Monkey? Or are they waiting for people to complain and handling them one-by-one?**
    * Ideas to solve
        * Prevention
            * Gnosis-like time lock
            * Alternatives to “Admins will never DM first”?
        * Recovery
            * Regular legal routes to recover stolen goods
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Don't feel helpless when you are taken advantage of (while using Web3) there are rules and laws to protect you</span>
    * Are there ways the Discord mods could have prevented outreach like that?
        * Probably OnChain Monkeys could not have done a better job
        * Discord could turn off DMs by DEFAULT // TWITTER POLL
        * Discord could track reputations of links, and have a official links list, warn for others
        * Discord could better explain which role are "official" and speak for the community
* Why might Discord need to be more vigilant than Twitter? It’s easier to look official on Discord, because they are small communities.

NOTES



* Push versus pull models of sending things from TW@tomiwa1a
    * Push implies change of control, including the `send` function in Solidity for Ether and the `safeTransferFrom` in ERC-721.
    * Best practice: [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/common-patterns.html?highlight=withdrawal#withdrawal-from-contracts](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/common-patterns.html?highlight=withdrawal#withdrawal-from-contracts)
    * Actual safety measure is: every time you send away control from your contract using a message send or safeTransferForm etc. make sure that from the possible ways that the recipient could enter back into your contract OR affect the global state does not violate any of your assumptions or preconditions	
* “Not a shill and chill”
* On-chain and off-chain digital identity–soul bound tokens
    * Basic definition of soulbound token
        * 1. It's a token—it's not intrinsically valuable, "it's just a number"
        * 2. It's nonfungible? comes from games, tattoos that meaning derived without, achievement badges? stolen valor?
        * 3. not transferable (OR should be identified with ONE person?!)
        * ENTRIKEN'S LAW: Your ownership of assets on a ledger is only as valid as your trust in the custodian who has physical control of the assets. // The ISSUE is the trusted party
        * What is a soul? This is a fundamental question for SBT. And how does something on a blockchain connect to a soul? Deep into the metaphysics.
    * Extensions?
        * Nobody says these have to be immutable / non-revokable
    * Others models
        * "immutable resume or report card" // incompatible with "right to be forgotten"
        * "permanent ratings"
        * "badges"
        * star ratings // people get sued over these
    * Technically, to implement this:
        * ERC-721 with transfer disallowed
        * "soul"
        * Send only to externally-owned accounts "wallets", not smart contracts
    * History of ERC-721

* @037 If you wanted to do an airdrop of coins to only a set of wallets that participated on another contract in a dev chain (example: Rinkeby), is there a way to do cross-chain verification using an arbitrary block height? (example: give 10 coins from Contact "A" in Mainnet if Wallet "A" interacted with Contract "B" on Rinkeby before block height "X"). This is to promote mass beta testing to hopefully catch bugs before live deploy.…
    * Option A – Bridge
        * Use Rinkeby to make a separate contract and use a bridge to send those tokens to the other chain.
    * Option B – “get hands dirty”
        * Rinkeby allowlist contract
            * Function isAllowlisted emits logs, not a view function, in other words ONE transaction results in MULTIPLE allow list validations
        * On Mainnet validate these logs
            * Validate multiple consecutive blocks, with difficulty, using parent block and difficulty, this only works with proof of work
            * Validate specific transaction using inclusion Merkle proof
            * Validate and the transaction receipt (see [Yellow Paper BERLIN](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), page 6, transaction receipt data structure) to confirm the logs were emitted
            * Optional: add a time limit to this redeemability (using block.timestamp)
    * Option C – Centralize
        * Time public time limits / redeem periods / for accountability
        * After that happens, everybody can see it and run the tool, copy this: [https://github.com/su-squares/update-script](https://github.com/su-squares/update-script) and [https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs-nft-whitelist](https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs-nft-whitelist)
