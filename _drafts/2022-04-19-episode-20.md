title: "DAO vote hacking"
description: "In episode 20, we discuss the recent Beanstalk hack, where vote buying was used to steal over $182 million from the DAO. We also delve into the security of bridges and the ratio of assets under management versus the size of the army watching the vault. Additionally, we examine the iron triangle of decentralized, scalable and secure systems, and why PoS is more centralized than PoW."
