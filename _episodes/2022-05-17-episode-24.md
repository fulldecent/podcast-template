title: "Living with Will"
description: "In episode 24, we have a special guest Living with Will. We discuss membership NFTs and utility, including how they can be used for gated access on Discord. We also talk about the ability to change NFT metadata, and the potential implications of this. We also address Vitalik's recent tweets about the energy use of blockchain, and compare it to Jared Diamond's book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive."
